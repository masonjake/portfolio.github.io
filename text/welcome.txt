Hello! Thank you for visiting my personal portfolio website.  I created this website using Bootstrap 5 as well as some custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The purpose of this site is to demonstrate everything I have learned in my coding bootcamp as well as show off some cool projects! On this page you will find a brief introductory video.   I chose to do a multi page appication rather than a dynamically updated HTML file. I will add dynamic styling in the future! Furthermore, I chose to fetch my text content for the pages as well instead of including large amounts of raw text in the HTML file. Please see my github(github.com/masonjake) for the full code. The navigation bar on the top of the screen will help direct you through all the pages. Finally, please see the footer to connect with me on social media. The best way to get in touch is by sending me a message on linkedIn!

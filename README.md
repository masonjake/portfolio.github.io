# Portfolio Website

This is a website that showcases the skils I have learned thiusfar in the MIT xPro bootcamp. There are a few pages with a bio, intro video and more.

### How to run locally:

1. Download the code
2. Open index.html with the browser of your choosing.

### Or

Visit the github pages site to view.

### Coming soon:

1. Fix the blue flash when clicking an item in the navbar.
2. Turn the portfolio into an SPA(single page application)
3. Add clear opaque overlays.
4. Fix the pages expanding on mobile when it is hovered.
5. Add styling with emotion UI instead of Bootstrap.
